# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

krb5: Kerberos (Network Authentication Protocol)
krb5:
krb5: Kerberos was created  by MIT as a solution to these network security
krb5: problems. The Kerberos  protocol  uses strong cryptography so that a
krb5: client can prove its identity to a server (and vice versa) across an
krb5: insecure  network connection. After  a  client  and server  has used
krb5: Kerberos to prove their identity, they can also encrypt all of their
krb5: communications to assure privacy and data integrity.
