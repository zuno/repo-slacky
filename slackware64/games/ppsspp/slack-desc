# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

ppsspp: PPSSPP PSP emulator written in C++
ppsspp:
ppsspp: PPSSPP is a PSP emulator written in C++, and translates PSP CPU 
ppsspp: instructions directly into optimized x86, x64 and ARM machine code, 
ppsspp: using efficient JIT dynamic recompilers (dynarecs).
ppsspp:
ppsspp: PPSSPP can thus run on quite low-spec hardware, including stronger 
ppsspp: Android phones and tablets, as long as there's support for 
ppsspp: OpenGL ES 2.0.
